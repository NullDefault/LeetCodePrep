"""
~The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221

~1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
~11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
~21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

~Given an integer n where 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
 ~You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits,
  ~counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

~Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
